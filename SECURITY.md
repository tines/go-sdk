## Reporting a Vulnerability
As a security company, we have a commitment to providing a secure and trusted platform to our users. We value security researchers and others who keep a watchful eye and responsibly disclose security issues. Should you find any security vulnerabilities, we ask that you please disclose to us via our Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) powered by BugCrowd.
